        Following an <em> update on May 22, 2017</em>, Supercell released the <em>new "Builder Base" game mode</em> to the game.
         It allows players to sail to a <em>new island</em> and create a new village with a different set of buildings. 
        In the "Builder Base" game mode, players can attack each other's bases simultaneously. The player who deals the most damage or getting more stars can get rewards such as gold, elixir, and trophies. However, the <em>gold and elixir</em> can only be won for the <em>first three victories</em> made by the player within a <em>twenty-four hour</em> timeframe, but can continue attacking for <em>trophies</em> afterwards.
        Players can spend gems to speed up the in-game time. The progress will be much faster in this base with the introduction of <em>Clock Tower</em> (temporarily speeds the process in the entire Builder Base) and Gem Mine. A new hero, <em>the Battle Machine</em>, was also introduced along with this update. It is the <em>only hero</em> in the game that has a reusable ability named <em>Electric Hammer</em>. In March 2018, Builder Hall level 8 was released while the June 2019 update brought Builder Hall 9 which is currently the highest Builder Hall level. This update also brought OTTO Hut, a secondary builder that can only be unlocked by finishing a number of in game challenges. When unlocked the master builder can be moved between the Builder Base and the Home Village.
