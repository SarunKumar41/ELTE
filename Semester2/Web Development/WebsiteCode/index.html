            <p>This is the <em>fanpage</em> of the mobile game available on both android and ios. The game is set in a <em> fantasy-themed persistent world</em> where the player is a chief of a village. Clash of Clans tasks players to build their own village using the resources gained from attacking other player's villages; earning rewards, buying them with medals or by producing them at their own village. To attack, players train different kinds of troops using resources. The main resources are <em>gold, elixir and dark elixir</em>. Players can conjoin to create clans, groups of up to fifty people, who can then participate in <em>Clan Wars</em> together, donate and receive troops, and chat with each other.</p>

                    <h2>News</h2>
                    <p>In the coming update, we’ll be doing reductions to upgrade costs and upgrade times across the board. We wanted to make the journey from Town Hall 7 to Town Hall 12 a bit smoother so... from Troops to Heroes to Defenses to Spells, we’re slashing costs! </p>

                        <p>The game also features a pseudo-single-player campaign in which the player can attack a series of fortified goblin villages and earn gold, elixir (and dark elixir in higher levels).</p>

                <p>Clash of Clans is an <em>online multiplayer game</em> in which players form communities called clans, train troops, and attack other players to earn resources. There are four currencies or resources in the game. Gold and elixir can be used to build and upgrade defenses and traps that protect the player's village from other players' attacks and to build and upgrade buildings. Elixir and dark elixir are also used to train and upgrade troops and spells. <em>Gems</em> are the premium currency. Attacks are rated on a three-star scale and have a maximum timed length of three minutes. </p>
