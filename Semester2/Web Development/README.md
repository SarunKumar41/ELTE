# Static Website Description

**The website can be accessed by [clicking here](https://people.inf.elte.hu/iwcyyd/WebsiteCode/index.html). The website is a fan page of a mobile game known as Clash of Clans.**  

## The code provided is from a Static Website that completes the following requiremts(the Website is mostly HTML and CSS as per the requiremts):

* Website has at least 4 pages; the filename of the home page is index.html
* There is at least one page (or block) that contains a background image
* There are at least 5 images inserted on the pages. At least 2 images should be thumbnails (to be linked to the original version of the image)
* "There is a page that contains a table (at least 2x3 in size, with table header (<th>), caption, and summary). Note: The layout of the website shouldn't be realized by tables!"

* "There is a page that contains a form which includes at least:
    - 1 input text field
    - 2 radio buttons
    - 1 textarea
    - 1 checkbox
    + resetting and submitting buttons.
    - The form can really be submitted, for example to an e-mail address."

* There is a page that contains a JavaScript script which improves user experience, for example choosing an alternative style sheet. (The script should not be one covered in class.)
* All the webpages should be filled with content. Besides the basic structural links, the website should contain 3 external links.
* The HTML5 pages should give an example for the use of all of the following tags: <header><nav><section><article><aside><footer><figure><video>
* The website is in English.
* Useful content is presented on the home page, the topic/aim of the site is evident from the home page 
* The content (without navigation) comprises 50-80% of the site.
* Content and appearance (design) are separated appropriately with the use of external style sheets
* The pages have unique titles, and start with a keyword (eg. About me – Website of Thomas Smith)
Each page is clearly labelled with a descriptive and useful title that makes sense as a bookmark
* Semantic coding is characteristic for all pages (lists are realized by list elements (<ul><li>), headings are headings (<h1>, not bolded, bigger letter texts)
* The text is readable with the default font size
* At the font settings, besides concrete font types, general font families are also given; for smaller text sans-serif font type is set
* Font size is set in a way that text could be easily resized (% or em)
* The navigation menu is at the top or on the left side of the page, it can be clearly distinguished from the main content
* Visited and non-visited links are different in appearance, the contrast of visited links is higher that that of non-visited links
* There should be no underlined texts that are not links
* Links should be underlined (navigation menu and list of links might be an exemption)
* Pages should be printable, the print preview should show all the important information
* Fields on forms have labels, which clearly explain what entries are desired
* The length of text boxes on forms is set according to the expected answer
* Labels are close to the data entry fields
* The content of the form can be sent to an e-mail address
* Radio buttons and check boxes cover all the possible answers (options should be carefully designed)
* The function of buttons in a form is clearly indicated by their label
* The are no spelling mistakes and typos
* Based on the scanning principle, keywords are emphasized, and if it is necessary, lists are used
* Well formulated headlines (<h1>…<h6>) structure the text on each page
* Headings are logically embedded, for example there cannot be only H2-s on a page, H1 cannot have H3 as a direct child, etc.
* The background shouldn't have a pattern that makes reading the text difficult
* Text blocks and lists are left aligned (or justified)
* A frame (poster) is cut and shown from the video, so that the user could decide whether it is worth watching the video.
* The thumbnails are prepared by cutting the most relevant parts of the pictures, and they are not just minimized version of the original pictures
* There is no infinitely running animation on the website
* There is no unuseful, superfluous welcome screen (splash screen)
* The same structural links are displayed on every page
* If someone navigates to the site from an outside source, they can easily find out which page they are looking at (eg. differentiating the current page in the menu, breadcrumb, etc.)
* The home page and the other pages are not different in their visual design, one can recognize that they are on a different page of the same website, and havent't navigated away from the original site
* For pictures not displayed with a design purpose, the ALT attribute is precisely filled in.
* The texts of links are understable on their own („click here” is not appropriate), and they are not longer than 4 words
* Texts are easily readable, contrast ratio is well-chosen
* Alternative style with bigger letters and higher contrast is provided for the visually impaired
* Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. (WCAG 2.0 Level A)
* Videos also include the full script of the audio.
* The language of the site is set on each page. If a page has text in a language different from the default, language code is set properly.
* Character encoding is declared on every page. Special characters are correctly interpreted.
* There are no missing elements, broken links, non-working functions, error messages
* The website works functionally well with the most popular browsers (Chrome, FF, Edge) (not taking into account those HTML5 features that are not implemented in the given browser)
* All the web pages are regarded as valid by the  [Webpage Validator](http://validator.w3.org/ "W3 org validator") site
* At least one page is regarded as valid by the HTML5 document type
* "You have your own CSS file(s) containing at least 15 rules. The CSS files are valid according to [CSS Validator](jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
* If the Bootstrap framework has been used, self-created styles are properly separated from Bootstrap CSS files."
