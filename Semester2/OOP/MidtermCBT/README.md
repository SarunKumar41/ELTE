# Midterm Computer Based Test

Database of the Formula 1 competitors is stored in a text file. One database element consists of the family name of the competitor, the competitorâ€™s team's name, and the best lap time he has reached on Hungaroring. The best lap time is stored as 3 numbers: minute, second, and millisecond.

The file is ordered by team name and you can suppose that it is not empty.




## Task

Which teams had at least one good lap time (less than 1:17.00)? You have to create a class with methods first(), next(), current(), and end() for enumerating if the team had a good lap time or not. Other public methods cannot be created for this class.
