# Assignment 3

At every competition of the National Angling Championship, the results of the competitors were recorded and put into a text file. Every line of the file contains the name of the angler the ID of the competition (string without spaces), and the species and the size of the caught fishes (pair of a string without spaces and a natural number). Data is separated by space or tab. The lines of the file are ordered by the name of the anglers. The file is assumed to be in the correct form.




## Task

The task is to :

* Give the biggest caught catfish with its size, the contest ID and the anglerâ€™s name.
* And check if every angler caught a catfish bigger than 30 cm?
