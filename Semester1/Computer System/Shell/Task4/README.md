# Task 4

Create a shell script 4.sh which waits a file name from the command line (use parameter). The file contains two integers in each line. Check that they are really integers! The 4.sh script should change the order of the numbers in each line. 



## Example implementation

Suppose the name of the file is 4.sh then, it should work in the following way when the input file name is test.txt 



| Input(File Content)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|       Expected Output |              
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------| 
| 13 3 | 3 13 |
| 9 6 | 6 9 |
| 113 9 | 9 113 |
