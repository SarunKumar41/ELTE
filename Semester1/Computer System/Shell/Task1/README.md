# Task 1

Create a shell script 1.sh which waits two integers from the command line (use parameters) and decide their sum.  Check the parameters ! 



## Example implementation

Suppose the name of the file is 1.sh then, it should work in the following way 

./1.sh 5 6 => 11  

./1.sh 1 girl => second not number

./1.sh girl 3 => first not number

./1.sh boy girl => neither
